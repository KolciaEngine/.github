# KolciaEngine - 3D-only game engine, written in V programming language.

[It's main aim](https://github.com/KolciaEngine/organization-wiki/wiki/Why-does-KolciaEngine-exist%3F) to provide a stable and high-quality experience for game developers and scientists.

## [3 main postulates](https://github.com/KolciaEngine/organization-wiki/wiki/Main-postualtes) of KolciaEngine

- TDD - maximization of a code covered by tests to provide stable and as much as possible bug-free development experience.

- Documentation - since KolciaEngine is a tool for other developers, it need to be documented and how-to guided, so people can understand clearly how to achieve X with the tool. As a documentation framework [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) will be used.

- Real-world example driven development - every feature and module will be based on real-world project to prevent hollow or useless features.

## [Things](https://github.com/KolciaEngine/organization-wiki/wiki/Things-which-direct-development-process) which direct development process

- Open-source philosophy

- Performance first ([V](https://vlang.io/), ECS, [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/))

- Modularity

- Cross-platform* experience

- [V ecosystem](https://vpm.vlang.io/)
